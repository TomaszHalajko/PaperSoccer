# PaperSoccer

Game/prototype created for test within 7 hours. Probably there are some hiccups and code potentially could be written better, but time was limited and game is working as it should be. There is also simple Ai, menu for changing size of field.

Also you can check my [portfolio page](https://thdev.eu/). where I showed some of my other projects from past( mostly game development ).
